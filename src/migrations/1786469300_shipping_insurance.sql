-- Shipping insurance: some ordering-app orders carry a shipping_insurance_fee
-- that was silently dropped by the import. The money was never LOST — the
-- upstream total (which recon bills) includes it — but as a component it was
-- invisible: the order sheet's breakdown didn't sum to the total, P&L revenue
-- missed it entirely, and the cash-rail processor-fee derivation (total −
-- known fees) would have mislabeled it as processor gross-up.

ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN shipping_insurance_usd NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- Backfill from the preserved upstream JSON so P&L is correct immediately —
-- no pull required. Paste-imported rows have no insurance and stay 0.
